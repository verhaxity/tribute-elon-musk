                <h3>Elon Reeve Musk <span class="highlight">
                    Genius of the Century</span></h3>
                <p>Elon Musk is an inventor and an engineer. He is the owner of, among other things, <em>Tesla Motors and SpaceX.</em> Musk is a genius and will go down as one of the greatest engineers the world has ever seen. He is pushing the boundaries of science and technology with his ambitions in electric power and space. Like a true engineer, he has developed solutions for the problems of modern civilization. He has plans to solve our traffic problems with autonomous cars and tunnel networks. Perhaps more remarkable, he has plans to eliminate most of our fossil fuel dependence and switch to <em>cleaner</em> and more <em>sustainable sources</em> of energy.

While the deal was decided there is still speculation whether he will actually go through with it or not due to Musk wanting to back out on the grounds of Twitter having "too many bots." As of right now the deal is on hold but since the Elon Musk and Twitter made the deal, he might be made to purchase it through court.</p>
